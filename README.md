The FTIM program consists of three key modules: Encoding_Module, Imputation_Module, and Reconstruction_Module. The Encoding_Module is responsible for encoding the data, converting raw latitude and longitude information into a form of changing distance, and transforming absolute altitude values into relative altitude values. The Imputation_Module seeks to precisely impute missing values in trajectory data, ultimately outputting complete and continuous trajectory data in encoded format. The Reconstruction_Module then feeds on the output from the Imputation_Module, restoring it to the original trajectory format. The main operational environment of the FTIM program encompasses the following aspects.

Python               3.10

json5                0.9.25

h5py                3.11.0

pytorch-cuda          11.6

(1)Encoding_Module

This module primarily extracts information from raw JSON - formatted data and converts it into a format compatible with the Imputation_Module. Executing main.py accomplishes the data processing. The OpenSky data is stored in the Opensky_Original_Data folder. Note that due to storage limitations, only partial data samples are provided here; the complete dataset is accessible on the OpenSky official website.
To enhance readers' understanding of the data processing procedure, several intermediate datasets are preserved during the model's operation. The Data folder contains the raw data directly extracted from JSON files, while the Data_Diff folder holds the preliminarily transformed data. Subsequently, the processed data is divided into training and testing sets, which are stored in the Opensky_Original_Data and Opensky_Test_Data folders, respectively. Finally, the training and testing sets, saved in the Train_Test_H5_Data folder in the h5 format, are ready for use by the Imputation_Module.

(2)Imputation_Module

This module focuses on imputing missing values in encoded data to generate complete coded trajectory data. Before starting, move the data generated by the Encoding_Module to the Train_Test_H5_Data folder. Then, run main.py to initiate model training and testing. The trained model is saved in the Model_Saved folder, and test results are stored in the Result_Write folder for subsequent use by the Reconstruction_Module.

(3)Reconstruction_Module

This module specializes in restoring the imputed results from the Imputation_Module to trajectory data format. First, copy the data generated by the Imputation_Module to the Result_Write folder. Then, execute main.py to transform the imputed data into trajectory format, with the final trajectory data saved in the Final_Data folder.
